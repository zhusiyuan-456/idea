This project is an implement of ArrayBlockingQueue and LinkedBlockingQueue with simplify methods.
There are a producer and a consumer in both blocking queue,where producer add element in the queue and consumer take
element out of the queue. When the queue is empty, it will block the consumer and when it's full, it will block the
producer.
The blocking method use methods of synchronized: wait(), notifyAll();
The main method in ArrayBlockingQueue and LinkedBlockingQueue test Simultaneously readers and writers to show the
properties of blocking queue in multithreading.

Run the main methods in MyArrayBlockingQueue and MyLinkedBlockingQueue to
